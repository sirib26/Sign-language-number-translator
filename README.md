## ðŸŽ¯ Features
- Real-time prediction with webcam
- Recognizes numbers 0 to 9 using hand signs
- Uses MediaPipe for hand detection
- XGBoost model for classification

## ðŸ§  Tech Used
- MediaPipe (hand tracking)
- XGBoost (machine learning classifier)
- OpenCV (webcam input and display)
- scikit-learn (model training and evaluation)
- NumPy, Pandas (data handling)
- Joblib (model saving/loading)

## ðŸ“· Dataset Creation

For this project, I used a dataset of hand sign images.
